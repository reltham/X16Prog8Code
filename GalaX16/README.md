# GalaX16
This is the beginning of a Galaga like game for the Commander X16.

The contents of the GFX, SFX, and MUSIC folders should be placed into the SDCARD (or image file for the emulator). The files should just be in the root folder.

- zsmkit-0830.bin is needed to compile GalaX16. Thanks MooingLemur for making [zsmkit](https://github.com/mooinglemur/zsmkit/tree/main) work with Prog8!

Most of the sprites are now from Kenney.nl space shooter collections.
