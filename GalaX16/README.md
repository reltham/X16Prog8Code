# GalaX16

The contents of the GFX, SFX, and MUSIC folders should be placed into the SDCARD (or image file for the emulator). The files should just be in the root folder.

- zsmkit-0830.bin is needed to compile GalaX16. Thanks Mooinglemer for making [zsmkit](https://github.com/mooinglemur/zsmkit/tree/main) work with Prog8!
